## Release Notes for Cordova (Windows) ##

Update these notes using: git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges *remote*/3.5.x...HEAD

cordova-windows is a library that enables developers to create Windows 8/8.1 and WP8.1 application projects that support Cordova APIs.

[4.0.0-dev]

* Added support for Windows 10 Universal Apps. 
* To target Windows 10, add `<preference name="WindowsTargetVersion" value="10.0" />` to config.xml

**Known Issues with 4.0.0-dev and Windows 10**

- Windows 10 Technical Preview 2 does not have a command-line compatible emulator deployment scenario.  To deploy to an emulator, open your solution file in Visual Studio.
- The Windows SDK included with Visual Studio 2015 RC does not include a tool to deploy to a Windows 10 Phone.  To deploy to a phone, open your solution file in Visual Studio.
- `-AndContinue` APIs have been deprecated in Windows 10, so plugins may throw an exception if they call such APIs from a Windows 10 app.
- WinJS is included inline in the package.  In the future, it will be migrated to an NPM dependency, and the dependency will not include any UI-related files.  You should not take a dependency on WinJS UI functionality unless you include it yourself (see [WinJS on Github](http://github.com/winjs/winjs)).
